# WowDash UI Standard (BPA)

Must use WowDash styling across dashboards:
- Tables, badges, forms
- `radius-12`
- Status colors (success/warning/danger/info) consistently
- Keep spacing + typography aligned with existing template components

If a screen is added, reuse existing template layout components instead of introducing new UI systems.
